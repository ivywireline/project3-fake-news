		The Real headline data set seems to be larger than the Fake headline data set.
		Most of the headlines for both data sets are in English, but there are some French and Spanish headlines, as well as possibly other languages.

		Fake headlines seem to use ``Trump'' to refer to Donald Trump, while real headlines tend to use ``Donald Trump.''
		Fake headlines also tend to use more sensational or inflammatory terms such as declaring something ``an hilarious fail,'' or have grammatical mistakes like the aforementioned example.
		Headlines in general are all lowercase with no punctuation.
		However, it seems that the real headlines tend to be truncated, while the fake headlines seem to all have the full text.
		Some of the headlines are also misspelled (e.g. ``x jinpingi'' instead of ``xi jinping'').

		It is difficult to categorize headlines solely based on keywords, since the same word in different contexts could be either sensational, or factual.
		Some useful keywords could be ``racist'' (5 occurrences in fake, 2 occurrences in real), ``hillary,'' (18 occurrences in real, 97 occurrences in fake), and ``rigged'' (3 occurrences in real, 15 occurrences in fake).

		\item %2
		The Naive Bayes algorithm was computed by computing the conditional probability 
		\[
			P(x_i | c) =  \frac{count(x_i = 1, c)}{count(c)}
		\]
		for all $x_i$ in the training set, and for each class $c$ (i.e. ``real'' or ``fake'').
		The actual formula used involves using $m$ and $\hat{p}$ as priors in order to improve the accuracy of our model, since many words only occur once, or a few times.
		Thus, the formula we trained with was
		\[
			P(x_i | c) =  \frac{count(x_i = 1, c) + m\hat{p}}{count(c) + m}
		\]
		
		To predict whether a headline was real or fake, we computed the conditional probability
		\[P(x_1, ..., x_n | c) P(c)\]
		by computing 
		\[\prod_{i = 1}^{n}p(x_i|y=c)\]
		However, since for the less frequent words, $p(x_i|y=c)$ is very small, and multiplying them together may result in underflow, we computed the exponential of the sum of the log probabilities instead.
		Thus, our formula becomes 
		\[
			P(x_1, ..., x_n | c) P(c) = \exp\left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\log(P(x_i|y=c))\right)P(c)
		\]
		We then return the class with the highest probability as our prediction.\\
